/**
 * The btree is a linked structure which operates much like
 * a binary search tree, save the fact that multiple client
 * elements are stored in a single node.  Whereas a single element
 * would partition the tree into two ordered subtrees, a node 
 * that stores m client elements partition the tree 
 * into m + 1 sorted subtrees.
